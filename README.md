## Prepare Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset should be downloaded and placed inside the data/ directory in the form of batch files.

---

## Train the Model
To train the ResNet model, run:
```bash
python src/train.py
```
This will train the model for 300 epochs and save the best checkpoint as resnetVariant_best.pth.

---

## Run Inference
To test the trained model on new images:
```bash
python src/infer.py --model resnetVariant_best.pth
```

---

## Model Overview
- The architecture is a modified ResNet with 3 residual layers instead of deeper ResNet variants.
- Uses SGD with momentum, weight decay, and cosine annealing learning rate scheduler.
- The best model achieves 94.06% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 2.7 million parameters.

---

## Training Logs & Results
- Training logs are stored in `log.txt`.
- Training loss, lerning rate and validation accuracy curves are available in the main folder.
